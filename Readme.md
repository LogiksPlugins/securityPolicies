# Logiks IAM Policy Manager

IAM stands for Identity and Access Management.

Logiks supports Security Policies that can be used to authenticate and control access across multiple remote sites. Post Remote Login, Security Policiy allow scope control by privilge level and user levels.


Logiks Security Policy Manager gives you the tools to create and manage all types of IAM policies (managed policies and inline policies). To add permissions to an IAM principal entity (IAM domain or group) you can create a policy and then attach the various access and activity controls. You can attach multiple policies to a principal entity, and each policy can contain multiple permissions.

The impacts are reflected via auth, mauth, mapps and iam services. An application that needs to authenticate remotely using Logiks Security Policies, can do so using the above services.

Thank you
